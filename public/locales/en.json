        },
        "1": {
          "question": "How to convert pixels to inches?",
          "answer": "Use the formula: Inches = Pixels ÷ DPI (or PPI). For screens, typically use 96 PPI. For printing, use 300 DPI or higher."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "How many pixels is 1 inch?",
          "answer": "It depends on the resolution. At 96 PPI (standard screen), 1 inch = 96 pixels. At 300 DPI (standard print), 1 inch = 300 pixels."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "How many inches are in a pixel?",
          "answer": "At 96 PPI: 1 pixel = 0.0104 inches. At 300 DPI: 1 pixel = 0.0033 inches. The exact value depends on your display or print resolution."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "Is 300 pixels an inch?",
          "answer": "Yes, when using 300 DPI resolution (common for printing). However, on standard computer screens (96 PPI), 300 pixels equals about 3.125 inches."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "Can I convert pixels to inches on my phone?",
